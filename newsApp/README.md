# News App

## General Info

In this application developed with React Native, news from the fake API is displayed. There are scrollable images at the top of your home page. The FlatList below shows the visuals, headlines and summaries of the news. When you click on the news, you are directed to a page where the details of the news are displayed.

### Used Technologies

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [React-Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/)
- [Fake News Squirro API](https://fakenews.squirro.com/)

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Congratulations! :tada:
